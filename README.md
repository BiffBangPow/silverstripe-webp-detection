This is a basic skeleton, designed as a starting point for building Silverstripe 4 Extension modules.

This does not represent a working module, just the bare-bones.   Once you have created a new repo for your module using this template, you'll need to edit (as a minimum) the composer.json file to set a name, namespace, etc.

Code should be added in the `src`directory, following PSR autoloading guidelines for namespaces, directory structure, etc.
